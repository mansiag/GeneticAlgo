# Genetic Algorithm Code Snippets
- **BinaryString.py** : Generates a string of 1's
  * Population consists of 10 offsprings
  * Each offspring is a string of 0's and 1's of length 7
  * Fitness of offspring is denoted by maximum no. of 1's in string
  * Target is to generate fittest offspring using Genetic Algorithm Procedure
